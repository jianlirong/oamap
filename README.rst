Tools for analyzing hierarchically nested, columnar data without deserialization.

Introduction
------------

Data analysts are often faced with a choice between speed and flexibility. Tabular data, such as SQL tables, can be processed rapidly enough for a truly interactive analysis session, but hierarchically nested data, such as JSON, is better at representing relationships within complex data models. In some domains (such as particle physics), we want to perform calculations on JSON-like structures at the speed of SQL.

The key to high throughput for large datasets, particularly ones with many more attributes than are typically accessed in a single pass, is laying out the data in "columns." All values of an attribute should be contiguous in disk or memory because data are paged from one cache to the next in locally contiguous blocks. The `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_ and `Parquet <http://parquet.apache.org/>`_ file formats represent hierarchically nested data in a columnar form on disk, and `Apache Arrow <https://arrow.apache.org/>`_ is an emerging standard for sharing hierarchically nested data in memory. However, data from these formats are usually deserialized into conventional data structures before processing, which limits performance (see `this talk <https://youtu.be/jvt4v2LTGK0>`_ and `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01229>`_).

OAMap is a toolset for computing arbitrary functions on hierarchical, columnar data without deserialization. The name stands for Object Array Mapping, in analogy with the `Object Relational Mapping (ORM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping>`_ interface to some databases. Users (data analysts) write functions on JSON-like objects that OAMap compiles into operations on the underlying arrays, similar to the way that ORM converts object-oriented code into SQL. The difference is that mapping objects to non-relational arrays permits bare-metal performance (giving up some traditional database features).

OAMap is a Python library on top of which high-level analysis software may be built. It focuses on mapping an object-oriented view of data onto columnar arrays. `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ is OAMap's only strict dependency, though OAMap objects are also implemented as `Numba extensions <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/extending/index.html>`_, so they may be used in `Numba's <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_ JIT-compiled functions at speeds that match or exceed hand-written C code. OAMap is unopinionated about the source of its columnar arrays, allowing for a variety of backends. See the walkthrough (below) for more.

Also, a similar object array mapping could be implemented in any language— Python was chosen only for its popularity among data analysts.

Walkthrough
-----------

Start by installing OAMap:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install oamap --user

or similar (use ``sudo``, ``virtualenv``, or ``conda`` if you wish). Now you should be able to import the package in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    from oamap.schema import *

For this walkthrough, we'll be working with a real dataset, the `NASA Exoplanet Archive <https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/>`_. As an illustration of columnar data access, we can start working with it without fully downloading it. Type the following to get a schema.

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        from urllib.request import urlopen   # Python 3
    except ImportError:
        from urllib2 import urlopen          # Python 2

    baseurl = "http://diana-hep.org/oamap/examples/planets/"

    schema = Schema.fromjsonfile(urlopen(baseurl + "schema.json"))

If you're brave, try ``schema.show()`` to see its hundreds of attributes. This data object is a list of stars, each of which has attributes like distance, position on the sky, mass, and temperature, and each of those attributes has a central value, asymmetric uncertainties, and limit flags, packaged in record structures. Each star has a list of planets, with its own attributes, like orbital period, mass, discovery method, etc. Some of these, like discovery method, are strings, some are numbers, and most are "nullable," meaning that they could be missing (unmeasured or otherwise unavailable).

We can view the data as nested Python objects by providing a dict of arrays to the schema. (The ``DataSource`` below makes our website act like a Python dict.)

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy
    from io import BytesIO

    class DataSource:
        def __getitem__(self, name):
            try:
                return numpy.load(BytesIO(urlopen(baseurl + name + ".npy").read()))
            except Exception as err:
                raise KeyError(err.message)

    exoplanets = schema(DataSource())
